## Welcome to Ampt!

[<img src="https://getampt.com/button"/>](https://ampt.dev/start?template=spotify-slack-playlister)

This is app is used as an integration with any Slack channel. It listens to Spotify track URL's for any subscribed channel, and adds them into a central playlist. You will need to create a Slack app and Spotify app to make this ready. For detailed instructions on setting the Slack/Spotify apps up, see the tutorial blog post here.

To run this app locally, simply clone down this repository and run `ampt`. You may need to login to the Ampt CLI if you haven't already (you can install this by running `npm install -g @ampt/cli`). To start the local development server, run `ampt dev` or `dev` in the Ampt shell.

Happy coding!
